* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [D3.js] - JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data, helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS.

And of course Browsing History Analyzer itself is open source with a [public repository][Browsing-History-Analyzer] on GitHub.
